This is a sample template from Startup Bootstrap

so basically you downloaded the template from this website:

https://startbootstrap.com/previews/grayscale/


and copy paste this link to line 15: 

https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-grayscale

on line 15:

<link href="https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-grayscale/css/grayscale.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

and Voila you have the ready made website and just change the images and text.
